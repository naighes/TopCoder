## Problem statement
Hero owns a factory. There are n robots working at the factory. The robots are numbered `0` through `n-1`.
Today, exactly one of the robots became corrupted. Hero has decided to give all robots a test that may determine the number of the corrupted robot. The test works as follows: For each `x` from `0` to `n-1`, in order, Hero tells robot `x` a positive integer and the robot answers whether the integer is odd or even. Each normal robot will always give the correct answer. The corrupted robot may sometimes give the opposite answer. More precisely: the corrupted robot will answer incorrectly if and only if the previous robot was given an odd number. In particular, if robot `0` is the corrupted robot, it will give the correct answer (as there is no previous robot).

You are given a log of the test: a `int[]` query and a `String[]` answer, each with `n` elements. For each `x`, `query[x]` is the positive integer given to robot `x`, and `answer[x]` is the answer given by the robot: either _Odd_ or _Even_.

It is guaranteed that the situation described by query and answer could have occurred as described above. If it is possible to determine the index of the corrupted robot, return it. Otherwise, return `-1`.

## Examples
0. `{3,2,2}`
`{"Odd", "Odd", "Even"}`
**Returns**: `1`
_Robot 1 gave the wrong answer. Thus, robot 1 is the corrupted robot_
1. `{1,3,5,10}`
`{"Odd", "Odd", "Odd", "Even"}`
**Returns**: `0`
_All robots gave correct answers. Still, we can deduce that the corrupted robot must be robot 0. For example, robot 1 cannot be the corrupted robot: as robot 0's number was odd, robot 1 would have answered incorrectly if it were corrupted_
2. `{2,3,5,10}`
`{"Even", "Odd", "Odd", "Even"}`
**Returns**: `-1`
_Again, all robots gave correct answers. This time we cannot be sure which robot is corrupted. All we know is that it is either robot 0 or robot 1. Both possibilities are consistent with the given input data. Thus, we should return -1_
3. `{2,4,6,10}`
`{"Even", "Even", "Even", "Even"}`
**Returns**: `-1`
4. `{107}`
`{"Odd"}`
**Returns**: `0`
5. `{1,1,1}`
`{"Odd", "Odd", "Even"}`
**Returns**: `2`
